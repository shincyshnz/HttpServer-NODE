# Learn NodeJS http

This is a simple application for submitting "Name" to backend created for learning NODE js. Frontend is developed using REACT with an input field for submitting name to backend (using axios) and user list is displayed on the screen. In the backend we used NodeJs http interface to handle GET and POST requests.
